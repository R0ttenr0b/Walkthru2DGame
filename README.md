# Walkthru2DGame
This 2D grid navigation system allows users to navigate through a grid of images using text commands (up, down, left, right).
The images and their navigation data are stored in a JSON file.
Created a JSON file called "2dpics.json" The image filenames are located for the database in python
had some issues calling the image from the database to display but did my best and im proud of the work  i did
